# README #

This are my dotfiles I share across my computers.
Normally it is not recommendet to have multiple dotfiles in one repository. Nevertheless, that works for me quite good ;)


### gitignore_global ###
* ignore tmp vim files
* ignore tmp qt files
* ignore build folders (all my builds are in a folder named build*)
* ignore mac files

### vimrc ###
* all plugins I use and love :)
* mappings
* functions
* ...

### bootstrap.sh ###
* just a small helper script to create symlinks
